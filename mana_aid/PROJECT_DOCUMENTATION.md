# Mana Aid: Food Surplus Management System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview of the System

Mana Aid is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to facilitate the efficient management and distribution of surplus food from donors to recipients in need. The system addresses the critical issue of food waste by connecting food donors (restaurants, grocery stores, individuals) with food recipients (individuals, families, NGOs) through a user-friendly web interface.

The platform implements a role-based architecture with four primary user types:
- **Donors**: Individuals or organizations that have surplus food to donate
- **Recipients**: Individuals or families seeking food assistance
- **Volunteers**: Community members who help with logistics and distribution
- **NGOs**: Non-governmental organizations coordinating food distribution efforts

The system provides a complete workflow from food posting to distribution, including:
- Food surplus posting with detailed information (type, quantity, expiry time, pickup location)
- Food browsing and request submission by recipients
- Request management and approval by donors
- Real-time status tracking and communication
- Volunteer task coordination
- Sponsorship and funding management

### 1.2. Motivation for the Study

Food waste is a global crisis with significant environmental, economic, and social implications. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted annually. In developing countries, this waste occurs primarily at the production and post-harvest stages, while in developed countries, it happens mainly at the retail and consumer levels.

The motivation for developing Mana Aid stems from several critical factors:

1. **Environmental Impact**: Food waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and inefficient resource utilization
2. **Economic Loss**: Billions of dollars are lost annually due to food waste
3. **Social Inequality**: While food waste occurs, millions suffer from food insecurity
4. **Inefficient Distribution**: Lack of proper platforms connecting surplus food with those in need
5. **Digital Transformation**: Need for technology-driven solutions in social welfare systems

### 1.3. Research Problem

The research problem addresses the inefficiencies in current food surplus distribution systems:

1. **Lack of Coordination**: No centralized platform connecting donors and recipients effectively
2. **Information Asymmetry**: Donors and recipients lack visibility into available resources
3. **Manual Processes**: Reliance on phone calls, emails, and personal networks for coordination
4. **Quality Control**: Difficulty in ensuring food safety and quality standards
5. **Scalability Issues**: Current systems don't scale well for large-scale operations
6. **Tracking and Accountability**: Lack of proper tracking mechanisms for donated food
7. **Real-time Updates**: Absence of real-time information about food availability and status

### 1.4. Objective of the Study

The primary objectives of the Mana Aid system are:

1. **Develop a Digital Platform**: Create a web-based system for efficient food surplus management
2. **Facilitate Donor-Recipient Matching**: Enable seamless connection between food donors and recipients
3. **Ensure Food Safety**: Implement quality control and expiry tracking mechanisms
4. **Provide Real-time Information**: Enable real-time updates on food availability and status
5. **Support Multiple User Roles**: Accommodate donors, recipients, volunteers, and NGOs
6. **Implement Scalable Architecture**: Design a system that can handle growing user base and transactions
7. **Enable Data Analytics**: Provide insights into food distribution patterns and effectiveness
8. **Promote Sustainability**: Reduce food waste and promote efficient resource utilization
